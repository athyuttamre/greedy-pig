<P>
class AI is the mastermind class behind the artificial intelligence used by the computer; Through the course of the game, 
 the computer uses it to decide wether to roll or to hold in a particular turn. It deals with varying difficulty levels :
 easy, medium and hard (which is chosen by the user at the beginning of the game). In the 'easy' difficulty level, the computer
 plays a fairly random game, whereas in the 'medium' level and 'hard' level, the computer plays a very calculated game and decides
 based on three factors : 
 <ol>
 <li> The Computer's total score (comp.totalScore),
 <li> The Computer's score accumulated in this turn so far (comp.turnScore), and
 <li> The User's total score as of his/her last turn. (human.totalScore).</ol>
 
 Further interestingly, the basic mechanism of AI in the medium and hard levels are similar, except that in the 'hard' level,
 rather than making a more calculated decision as to roll or hold, the PROBABILITY of the computer rolling a 1 is reduced by 
 half, carried out by the hardRoll() method in the Dice class.

<DL>
<DD>compChoose : This method , depending on the difficulty level chosen by the user, the user's total score,
 the computer's total score and the computer's turn score, decides wether to roll or to hold in a particular turn.
 The Artificial Intelligence itself , therefore , is :
 <ul>
 <li> Difficulty Level Easy : In the easy difficulty level, the AI used by the computer is fairly random. The optimal limit for a
      turn's score lies between 15 and 25. Anything below this is too less an accumulation for that particular turn and anything 
      above can be considered too big a risk. Therefore, a random integer within the range 15-25 is obtained and the computer
      rolls until it equals or crosses the set limit; unless of course,if it reaches 100. Thus, essentially, the computer works 
      on an AI where the turn score is the only concern and defines optimal play.
 
 <li> Difficulty Level Medium : The medium level shares it's code with the hard level and thus is set as the default case
 when not easy in the switch statement in the method. In the medium difficulty level, the AI works upon two main clauses : If the computer's
      totalScore + turnScore (int cPS) is greater than the player's score ; or the player's score is greater than the cPS.
      In the first clause (cPS > human.totalScore), the following conditionals determine the decision :
          <ol>
          <li> if (100 - human.totalScore <= 18) return 'r'; This indicates that the human's total score is within 18 of 100,
               that is to say, he is VERY CLOSE TO WINNING THE GAME, and thus, since the computer should not resort to any strategy
               but to roll and try to beat the player, it rolls.
               
          <li> if(comp.turnScore >= 25) return 'h'; Since execution has come to this statement, it means that the human is fairly away
               from reaching a 100 (>18) and thus the computer must take it's turn score into accomodation. If in this case, where
               there is no urgency to roll and beat the player, the computer checks if it is risking too much for too little. If the
               turn score is already >=25 , then at anytime a 1 could be rolled and the whole score wasted. Thus, when the human is 
               fairly far away from a 100, and the computer is risking too much, the computer holds.
               
          <li> if(human.totalScore - cPs < 18 && comp.turnScore >=15) return 'h' ; Here, the computer looks at it's difference from
               the human in score and at the same time, it's own turn score. (human.totalScore - cPS < 18) implies that the computer
               is not too far away from the human and (comp.turnScore>=15) checks if the computer is risking too much. Thus, if the 
               computer is in a healthy stage where it is not too far away from the human, it must not risk too much of it's turn
               score, and thereby hold.
               
          <li> In this clause, if all the above sub-clauses are bypassed, the computer still remains at a score below that of the user.
               Therefore, when the computer is losing, the obvious reaction is to roll and try to catch up, which is exactly what is done
               through (else return 'r';). However, keep in mind that this is executed only if the above statements are not executed.
          </ol>
          
      In the second clause (cPS > human.totalScore && human.totalScore >=5), the computer is ahead of the user and the user himself
      is not at a score less than 5 (which could indicate either his very first turn or a very early turn). If he had been less than
      the computer would have applied AI which is unnecessary, for at this early stage of the game, a good accumulation of score is 
      the main aim. Therefore, if this clause is bypassed (either the two players' scores are equal, or human's totalScore < 5), the
      computer resorts to AI used in the easy difficulty level, aiming at accumulation score. This clause has two 
      sub-clauses, which decide the roll or hold :
          <ol>
          <li> if ((100 - cPS) <= 8 && cPS-human.totalScore <= 10 ) return 'r'; : (100 - cPS <=8) indicates that the computer is very
               close to reaching 100 and (cPS-human.totalScore <=10) indicates that at the same time, the human is fast on the computer's
               heels, within a range of 10. In this crucial stage of the game, where both players have a very high chance of winning
               the game, it makes sense to roll and try to get to a 100 before the other. This is safer for the computer has an advantage
               that the current turn is it's , thus it can try to win the game. Thus, it rolls in this condition.
               
          <li> if (cPS-human.totalScore >=10 && comp.turnScore >=15) return 'h'; Since execution has come to this stage,this indicates 
               both players are not necessarily very close to winning. Thus, the computer must take into account it's own turn score
               and check if it is risking too much. Hence, (cPS-human.totalScore >= 10) indicates that the human is at a fair distance
               away from the computer(>=10) and (comp.turnScore >=15) indicates that the computer's turnScore is a considerable amount
               (15 or more). Thus, if the conditional is true, the computer must not risk too much of it's turn score while in a fairly
               safe positon, and thereby hold.
          </ol>
      As mentioned previously, if both clauses fail, (either both scores are equal, or the second clause is false(due to human.totalScore
      < 5)) the computer retorts to the strategy of accumulating points, which is also used in the easy difficulty level. If both
      scores are equal, it is as though the computer is back at square one, with noone winning the game. Thus, it must try and gather
      score and outrun the human. If the computer's score is greater than the human's, and the human's score is minimal(<5), the computer
      tries and builds up a lead and resorts to this strategy.
          This strategy essentially takes a random integer within a range of 15-25, and rolls until it equals or exceeds this random number,
      ensuring a decent collection of score every turn.
      
<li>  Difficult Level Hard : The hard difficulty level essentially works on the same strategy as that of the medium level, but what
      makes the play harder for the user is the cheating involved. In this level, the dice of the computer, generally rolled by the
      randomRoll() method in the Dice class, is rolled by the hardRoll() method instead. The hardRoll() method, as described in the
      Dice class itself, DECREASES the probability of a 1 on the dice from 16.66 % to 8 % . Thus, the computer has a lot lesser 
      chances to lose the turn, and accumulates considerably more amount of points. This makes the game harder for the player.
          As far as the returning of 'r' or 'h' itself, the hard levels shares it's code with the medium level and is hence set 
      as the default case in the switch statemnt in the method.

<DD>randomInt : This method returns a random integer within a range of two integers(inclusive). Thus, it is used to 
 return a random integer between 15 and 25 , a range within which the limit for the turn score optimally should stand. Thus, in the easy
 level, the computer rolls upto this random integer, and then holds . Using the Math.random() function, a random double 
 is created, which is then used to create a random integer within the range.
